title: Missing Suspense with CSR Bailout
---

#### Why This Error Occurred

Certain methods like `useSearchParams()` opt Next.js into client-side rendering. Without a suspense boundary, this will opt the entire page into client-side rendering, which is likely not intended.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

Make sure that the method is wrapped in a suspense boundary. This way Next.js will only opt the component into client-side rendering up to the suspense boundary.
